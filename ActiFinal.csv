Portal to another world.","The Portara is the entrance to an unfinished temple that faces directly toward Delos, Apollo's birthplace. For this reason most scholars believe it was dedicated to Apollo, but some think it was built in honor of Dionysus, who was worshipped on Naxos Island.
Whichever god it was dedicated to, the temple was begun about 530 BC by the tyrant Lygdamis, who said he would make Naxos's buildings the highest and most glorious in Greece. Only the walls were mostly completed when he was overthrown in 506 BC the temple was never finished. Evidence from pottery indicates the temple's cult was abandoned by the 5th century BC.
By the 5th and 6th centuries AD, the temple had been converted into a church. Under Venetian and Turkish rule the temple was dismantled so its marble could be used to build a castle. The doorway, however, was so large and heavy it could not be used, so it remains standing alone among the ruins.","The Portara stands on Palatia, which was once a hill but is now a separate little island connected to Naxos by a causeway. (The Mediterranean has risen significantly since ancient times.) ","Tourists, History lovers",,"The rectangular door stands 26 feet (8m) high and is made of four blocks of marble, each 16 feet long and weighing 20 tons. The tenons (projections for lifting the blocks) were never removed, providing insight into the methods of temple construction.

71,Halki village,Its glorious past is apparent in its architecture,"Halki (Chalki) village used to be the capital of the island as well as its main administrative and trade centre. It is located in the centre of Naxos, 16 km from Hora, or Naxos Town in the central area of the valley of Tragea and is now the administrative centre of the municipality of Drimalia. The region of Tragea is the principal olive cultivation area of the Cyclades. It is speculated that Halki’s name is derived from a family of bronze smiths who were settled in the region by the Venetians (Greek - Chalkos = Bronze). ",,"Halki has a long history and the numerous neoclassical houses and buildings are testimony to the wealth and power the village once exerted in the surrounding area. Apart from the lovely old mansions and the picturesque churches, the village itself has colorful alleys that give visitors the sense that they have somehow gone back in time. Many well preserved houses, Venetian Towers and fine Byzantine churches can be found in the area. One of these is amongst Naxos’ oldest churches, the Church of Panagia (the Virgin), dating from the 9th century with some beautiful Byzantine and post-Byzantine frescoes. ",,"It is a very fertile area of Naxos and in conjunction with the olive groves that cover many square kilometers, the “Citron” tree from which the famous Naxian liqueur is produced, is everywhere to be seen. ",Visit the Kitron Museum.

72,Filoti village,Amphitheatrically built on the steep slopes of Mount Zas,"Even though today it is one village, it is in fact comprised of three smaller settlements Liiri, Klefaro and Rachidi. The population totals about 1,800 which make it the largest village in numbers on Naxos and the Cyclades in general. The village is situated 18km from the capital of Naxos. It is a traditional Cycladic village built amphitheatrically on the slopes of mount Zas, with whitewashed, flat roofed houses and narrow heavily flowered streets. The inhabitants use their roofs as balconies or terraces for the warm summer months. The main street is the centre of village life in terms of café and restaurants. The little paved square named Gefyra (Greek - bridge), is surrounded by picturesque “kafenia” (Greek traditional cafes) also serving ouzo and snacks and a number of taverns and retail outlets, all shadowed by a huge, majestic plane tree allowing for a cool breeze. ","One of the most famous and beautiful villages of the island is Filoti in the Tragea region, which is well-known for its olive groves and little Byzantine churches, both of which are also found in the village. Filoti’s name is ancient and believed to be of Ionian origin. ","The church Panagia (Virgin Mary) Filotitissa is located here. Standing tall, a little further down the road, the Barozzi Tower is a striking remnant of the island’s lengthy period of Venetian rule. Next to the tower, a marble wall with an inset marble tap has constantly running spring water and is accompanied by an inscription dating back to King Otto (Greek - Othon), who reigned from 1832 to 1862. He was and was the first king imposed on modern age Greece (Post Hellenic Revolution) and was of Bavarian descent. Rachidi, the village’s other main neighborhood, is on the uphill route south of the tower. ","Roughly 60,000 sheep are reared in this area so the village is well-known for the excellent quality of its livestock products, such as lamb and goat’s meat and a wide variety of cheese products (anthotyro, arseniko, kefalotyri, myzithra and xinotyro), while a cooperative of local women produce and sell homemade sweet preserves (Greek - Glyka koutaliou). ","Interesting sights in Filoti’s surrounding area include the fountain of Arion, on Zas mountain’s slope, the Zas cave where Zeus was born according to mythology, Chimarros tower on the road to Kalandos, as well as numerous Byzantine chapels with original frescoes. ","The main attractions are of course the breathtaking amphitheatric view of the mountains, the relaxing climate and surroundings and the opportunity to stroll through the village’s picturesque alleys. The surrounding impressive summits have two openings, one toward Tragea in the west, the other toward the local livestock farms in the south.

73,Damarionas village,In between olive groves and lush vineyards,"
Damarionas is a traditional village on Naxos. The village is considered mountainous although it is only at an altitude of 230 meters. It is a beautiful settlement built on the south side of the sunny Tragea valley. ","In the village stand the mansions' “Prompona”, “Vasilikoulas” and “Bakalainas”, the beautiful “Square of Potirou” with a huge and very old plane tree and the old churches of Christ and St. George in the Patelou square. ","The village apparently acquired its name from Damaris the Athenian who was amongst the very first to accept Christianity and passed it on to the settlement who honored her by naming the village after her.
It is estimated that the first inhabitants of Damarionas actually inhabited the coastal area of Agiassos, but the prevalent fear of the pirates, forced them to migrate inland, originally in the area of Roalidia, on the slopes of the Castle of Apaliros and later, around 1400, to their current location.
In 1981 the population of this lovely village was 522 and only ten years later in 1991 it was down to 313. Today it numbers around 350. This is a phenomenon occurring everywhere in Greece since the nature of available work has changed. ",,n Damarionas there is also the “Androniki” Spiritual and Cultural Center that serves as a space for meetings and conferences. ,"Damarionas is also home to many picturesque early Christian chapels in the greater area of Baouzi as well as the famous early Christian church of “Kaloritsa”, built in a cave on the western side of mount Ai Lias (St. Elias - Elijah).

74,Apeiranthos village,The mountainous village of timeless beauty,"Amphitheatrically built at the slopes of Mount Fanari, it boasts magnificent views of the Naxian mountain ranges. As the locals say, while at Apeiranthos, there is no way of telling that you are, in fact, on an island. The feeling one gets is more that of a northern mainland Greece village than that of a Cycladic Island. This is partly due to its architecture and stone built houses but mainly due to its altitude, the centre of the village is located at approximately 600m from sea level. ","But its most impressive feature is its architecture. Stone built towers, old houses and churches, marble paved alleys, traditional small souvenir and local craftsmanship shops. It is a photographer’s paradise in all its glory… ","Apeiranthos village is by many considered the crown jewel of Naxos. Much of this belief is due to the fact that over the centuries it has managed to retain its unique authenticity which is apparent in every step you take, in every alley you walk and wherever you look. This is so not just because of the village and its uniqueness on the landscape of Naxos, but also for its nearly 1100 proud inhabitants who have kept their own distinct dialect where even a slightly trained ear reveals their true Cretan origin. ",,The altitude offers extraordinary views from its various restaurants serving the local produce and the café most of which overlook the surrounding peaks and valleys. ,"At Apeiranthos you will find not one or two but 5 museums:
the Apeiranthos Archaeological Museum
the Geological Museum
the Museum of Natural History
the Visual Arts Museum and
the Folklore Museum
all worth visiting. ",,,,,images/apeiranthos.jpg,images/apeiranthos.jpg,images/apeiranthos.jpg,"37.0708924,25.5159971"
